# `hslike`

This package provides estimations for the Horseshoe-like prior.  The [project page][hslike]
is on Github.

## Installation from R

Currently, remote installation in R (without cloning this repository and building locally) requires 
the [`devtools`][dt] package and something like the following:
```
devtools::install_github("DattaHub/hslike")
```
then, as usual, load the library with `library(hslike)`.


## Development Setup and Installation


The following is a quick, simple example of local development for this package in R
(see [here][dev] for more details).
Assuming you've pulled the source from the repository into `~/projects/code/hslike-r-pkg`:

```R
library(devtools)

options(error=recover)

dev_mode(on=T)

#
#  Assuming you're in the root directory of this repo
#  (and it's named `hsplus-r-pkg`), execute the following
#  to install the package in development mode: 
#
install_local("../hslike-r-pkg")

#
#  Load all functions and variables into the environment, even
#  those that aren't expected to be exposed in public version of the package.
#
load_all("./", export_all=T)

#
#  Do some work, could be in this file, or another.
#
...

#
#  Check that your changes don't break anything else (and that they
#  work, since one should always write tests for their new code)
#
test("./")

#
#  Run these when you're happy with your changes and want to add
#  any new functions and/or update documentation.
#
document("./")

dev_mode(on=F)

```
